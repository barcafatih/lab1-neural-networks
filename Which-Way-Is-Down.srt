1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,040
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,780
Down here.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,560
But which way is down?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,419
And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about a 100th of a gram per cubic centimeter.

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,059
It is light and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds.

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,379
But if you let go of down...

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,839
It falls down.

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,579
So that's which way down is.

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,960
It's the direction gravity is pulling everything in.

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,920
Now, for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,420
But where are falling things going? Why do things fall?

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,680
Are they being pushed, or pulled, or is it because of time travel?

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,460
First things first: let's turn the Sun into a black hole.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,000
We can do that using Universe Sandbox 2, this simulator will blow your mind. I love it.

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,379
In fact, I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current Curiosity Box.

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,179
If you're not subscribed to the box yet, you are missing out!

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,240
Okay, look, for the purposes of this video, we want the Solar System.

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,419
And here it is. Notice that everything's moving pretty quickly around the Sun.

19
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,719
That's because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us,

20
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,219
is 14 days, almost, in the game.

21
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,739
If I change this to one second,

22
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,280
we're looking at the Solar System in real time.

23
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,879
You'll notice that it almost looks like it's frozen.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,599
Even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 km/s, it barely appears to be moving.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,640
That is how vast space is. Anyway, let's go back to 14 days

26
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,560
I like that motion. Now look at the Sun

27
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:43,258
It is not, currently, a black hole, but we can change that. What we need to do is compress the Sun.

28
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,719
So let's lock its mass so that it doesn't change while we make its radius smaller.

29
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,959
Let's make its radius as small as we can.

30
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,859
And, oh, where'd it go? Well it's still there, it's just become a black hole.

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,439
Pretty spooky, but now, let's look at the rest of the Solar System.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,819
Alright, zooming out and-

33
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,959
huh.

34
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,120
Nothing's... changed. I mean something's changed.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,000
It's colder and darker, but nothing's flying off into space or getting sucked in.

36
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,340
You see,  by shrinking the Sun, we didn't change the direction of down for the planets.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,739
They're always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didn't move where the middle was.

38
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,799
But also, the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same.

39
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,419
That gives us a clue as to what down is.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,980
The clue is the other thing we didn't change: mass.

41
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,199
Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something; to change its motion.

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,400
Now right now, these two balls have zero motion relative to me.

43
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,560
Slapping around this hollow plastic ball

44
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,109
is pretty easy, but doing the same to this solid steel ball

45
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,679
is a lot harder.

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,939
Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this.

47
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,280
Gravity acts downward, not against my horizontal slapping.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,400
Of course, gravity does contribute to friction, but friction works against me when I start moving the ball,

49
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:19,018
but works with me when I stop the ball.

50
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,739
And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball.

51
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,149
The difference is mass. The steel ball is more massive

52
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:30,939
It's more resistant to having its motion changed.

53
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:36,699
Mass is an intrinsic property; it does not depend on what's around or change from place to place.

54
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,619
It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,960
Your mass is the same regardless of where you are.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,760
On the moon, on earth, in the middle of intergalactic space floating around.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,300
But all of this said, mass does seem to care about what's around.

58
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,359
Mass loves company.

59
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:03,359
Things with mass and/or energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity.

60
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,189
The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another.

61
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,119
Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it.

62
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,860
The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass.

63
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:26,500
Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull, but everything does. Even a baseball.

64
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:32,219
These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities.

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,920
Except their masses are so small, the force is minuscule, and it can't overcome friction or push air out of the way.

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,889
They're never gonna come together

67
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:51,809
But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them

68
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,578
They would literally fall together and collide.

69
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,538
It would take three days to happen, but it would.

70
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:07,438
Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses

71
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:15,389
Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G, the gravitational constant.

72
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,779
If you make one of two objects more massive, or move them closer together, the force will be

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,360
stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight

74
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,260
So mass is intrinsic, whereas weight depends on what's around.

75
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:35,138
Now, a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales.

76
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,520
Weight is a force, but scales display pounds or kilograms,

77
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,979
which are units of mass.

78
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,840
What's going on is that a scale is

79
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,699
activated by a force.

80
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,288
Any force.

81
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,999
It doesn't have to be caused by gravity. The scale then displays what amount of mass

82
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,310
near the surface of the earth would be attracted to the earth with the force it's detecting.

83
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,818
Now since scales tend to be used on the surface of the earth, by people, on which the only force acting is gravity,

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:11,468
they tend to not be very far off. But they can be easily tricked, and they further lead to the confusion between mass and weight.

85
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:20,288
Notice that weight is mutual. You are pulled down by earth with the same force that you pull up on earth.

86
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,258
According to a scale, I weigh

87
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,990
180 pounds on earth..

88
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,430
And the earth weighs 180 pounds on me.

89
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,889
But because the Earth's mass is so much greater than my own, and

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,530
because the more massive something is, the more it resists being moved, our

91
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,730
equal and opposite weight forces accelerate me a lot more than the earth.

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,588
If you drop a pencil from a height of 6 feet, the pencil doesn't just fall to the earth. More precisely,

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,870
they both come together.

94
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,718
They're attracted to each other by equal forces

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,029
but the same force moves the pencil a

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,369
lot more than the earth. When you let go of the pencil, the earth is literally pulled up

97
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,889
to the pencil by the pencil's own gravity, a distance equal to about 9 trillionths

98
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,639
the width of a proton. That

99
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:24,959
same force moves the pencil the remaining distance, which is still pretty much six feet.

100
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:32,219
At the height of the International Space Station's orbit, you and earth are attracted about

101
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:39,149
10% less than when you're on the surface; about eight point eight times your mass, but not zero.

102
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:46,678
For this reason, weightless astronauts in zero gravity are neither weightless, nor in zero gravity.

103
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,720
Their weight force fails to bring them and earth together, because they move horizontally

104
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,690
so quickly that they fall just as fast as Earth's surface curves away from them.

105
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,759
And even though they're experiencing 90 percent of the gravity you and I are feeling right now,

106
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,750
(That's why they don't just fly away)

107
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,879
There are no forces, called g-forces, to resist their weight, since everything around them is falling too.

108
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,170
It's resistance to your weight force, stress,

109
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:23,188
deformation, that is needed for you to feel weight. What astronauts in orbit actually lack is

110
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,129
apparent weight.

111
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,460
Likewise, a helium balloon has weight.

112
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,298
I mean, it's made out of matter it clearly has mass, so it's attracted to the earth.

113
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,119
Let's try to measure its weight force.

114
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,759
Okay, it has negative apparent weight.

115
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:52,580
That's because its attraction to the earth is weaker than the buoyant forces from the air around it that push it up.

116
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,500
Now, while it moves up,

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,700
It pushes air molecules down, but they transfer that force widely. Not just directly down onto the scale.

118
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,369
Buoyant forces are caused by the fact that whenever you are immersed in a fluid like water or air,

119
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,760
molecules lower down are at greater pressure.

120
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,310
They're being pressed by the weight of all the molecules

121
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,469
above them and are closer to earth, so they're pulled to it with a stronger force. Now having greater pressure

122
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,709
means they pack a bigger punch when they collide with things.

123
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,458
So,

124
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,548
horizontally, those collisions cancel out,

125
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,239
but vertically, the stronger collisions from below win out, providing lift, a buoyant force.

126
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:38,478
This even happens on your own body. Across its surface area air lifts you with the force of about one

127
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:45,589
Newton, which is equal to the weight force of an apple. So if you weighed yourself in a vacuum you would weigh about

128
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,839
this much more.

129
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:54,678
But that's not all Earth's spin causes it to bulge at the equator so the closer you are to it

130
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:01,759
The further you are from Earth's center of mass and the less your actual gravitational weight will be down is

131
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,190
Always changing, I mean

132
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:11,028
where is Earth's center of mass? It would always be the same as Earth's geometric middle if Earth's

133
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:18,379
composition was uniform, but earth contains pockets of massive rock at different depths water mountains

134
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,778
It's got moving changing insides and air and seasonal ice and though they're far away

135
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,798
Gravity extends forever from everything so the moon the Sun the planets all of them pull on you

136
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,819
negligibly,

137
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,289
But truly. You weigh about a millionth of your weight less when the moon is directly above you

138
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:46,740
This chunky shifting balance of material on earth and ever where else in the universe means that down is

139
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,250
always

140
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,849
changing on top of that Earth's spin

141
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,820
Skews what you consider the direction of down away from its center of mass because the push you get from Earth's spin

142
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,439
Seems to slightly lift you reducing your apparent weight and bending down

143
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,309
towards the equator

144
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:10,500
The net result is an apparent weight reduction at the equator of about half of a percent if a scale guesses your mass must be

145
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,038
200 pounds at the poles it'll guess that you're

146
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:18,239
199 at the equator. The 9.8

147
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:24,689
Multiplier used so often in physics is calculated based on how these factors affect someone at 45 degrees latitude

148
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:30,418
all of these influences on the direction of down result in a total vertical deflection.

149
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,769
That's only ever at most a few arc seconds anywhere on earth

150
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:41,819
That's not enough to be felt, but changes in direction and strength can be used to study the shape of the seafloor

151
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:47,370
Determine what's under you or even help you discover ancient buried rooms?

152
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,969
Point is all of our downs aren't a bunch of radially symmetric lines

153
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:57,028
Down is an uncombed mess.

154
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:03,240
Now since solids don't flow they can have shapes that don't pay much mind to this but water can

155
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:11,249
Flow so ignoring influences like wind and tides the surface of oceans and lakes and puddles is always perpendicular

156
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:17,070
To down if water could pass through land, or if earth were submerged in water

157
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,418
Gravity would be the same everywhere along its bumpy surface

158
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:26,250
Such a surface is called a geoid and can be drawn at any altitude

159
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:32,458
If you wanted to build a table that completely enclosed the earth it would have to have rolling undulation

160
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,338
Z' nearly 100 meters at some points in order to be

161
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,629
Level so that a ball placed anywhere on it wouldn't roll

162
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,620
Here is Earth's G. I exaggerated a thousand times

163
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,180
You'd weigh about a hundredth of a percent less a few grams here?

164
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,908
Then you would say here where gravity is a bit stronger point is the strength and direction

165
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,728
Down is variable by location and changes over time

166
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:04,278
So down is a fluctuating vector easy enough except?

167
00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:08,538
Why should matter attract matter in the first place?

168
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,759
Isaac Newton was able to describe attraction, but not explain it

169
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:19,369
humanity got closer however when Albert Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity

170
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,988
Einstein thought a lot about the fact that everything falls to the ground

171
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,507
At the same rate no matter

172
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,108
How massive something is when dropped it will accelerate towards the earth down gaining about 9.8

173
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:37,249
Meters per second for every second that it falls. That means that a hammer

174
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:44,628
That's quite massive, and a not so massive feather when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time

175
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,818
Okay, what just happened...

176
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:51,989
was an "air"ror.

177
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,038
awkward laugh

178
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:56,389
In order to fall through air a thing has to push air out of the way

179
00:13:56,548 --> 00:14:01,759
But if it has a large surface area and a low weight force it will have a lot of air to move

180
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:07,278
But won't be able to move that air very quickly. In a vacuum, things do fall at the same rate regardless

181
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,940
Of mass. This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 commander David Scott on the moon

182
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,659
And I'll, uh, drop the two of them here and hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time.

183
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,259
How 'bout that?

184
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,340
That's weird right? I mean if a more massive object is pulled with a greater force

185
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,589
Shouldn't it fall faster? Well Newton's explanation was simple:

186
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:34,159
Larger masses are attracted with greater forces

187
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,438
But will also require more force to be accelerated the same as a less massive thing

188
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:46,008
Something a hundred times more massive might require a hundred times the force, but it will be pulled by gravity

189
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,769
100 times more so everything falls to earth at the same rate

190
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:54,499
What a fun coincidence right?

191
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,739
Maybe not

192
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,749
Einstein realized that there's another way for things to appear to fall together

193
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,399
of their masses

194
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:12,888
Imagine a feather and a hammer floating in space in a room if the room is suddenly accelerated up at 9.8

195
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:18,078
M/s^2 the feather and the hammer will hit the floor at the same time

196
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,319
furthermore whether it's the room coming up to meet them or gravity being suddenly switched on

197
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,918
Neither object will feel any force pushing them

198
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,317
There's no way to tell which of these happen. This is Einstein's famous

199
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,399
equivalence principle

200
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,618
He once admitted that his greatest thought ever was that of a man

201
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,438
falling off of a roof

202
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:48,557
While falling the man would not feel any forces on him even though. He's speeding up

203
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,909
freefall is

204
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:57,289
Indistinguishable from floating alone in space from having no forces on you from not being moved

205
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:03,557
What if gravity isn't a force at all what if things fall not because they're being pushed or pulled

206
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:07,788
But because they're not being pushed or pull

207
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,619
To see how this could be we need to talk about straight lines

208
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,388
What I have here is a retractable ID badge holder

209
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,209
This is a great way to test for straight paths

210
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,168
Because the string is always kept taut the card

211
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,749
I have behind has two lines drawn on it

212
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:32,057
And if while I pull the string out it always stays between those two lines

213
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,458
I will know that I never turned

214
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,699
While I pulled it because any turn will translate into a different angle between the lines on the card and the string

215
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:47,177
Now if I put two of these on a flat table and pull them out, always ensuring that they go straight ahead

216
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,128
They will never meet. They will be forever parallel, but now let's put them on a sphere a curved surface

217
00:16:55,798 --> 00:17:02,119
Again, I pull both strings forward making sure that they always are pulled out straight. No turning

218
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:05,058
Wait they came together

219
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,309
Well, they didn't turn look

220
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:15,840
Maybe there's some kind of weird force that pulled my hands together and just like gravity. I didn't feel it, but it happened

221
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,560
No

222
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,440
What happened was not the result of a force it was just a natural result of?

223
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,970
Curvature you might be thinking wait a second are those really straight lines. I mean they don't look that straight to me

224
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,500
Also, what if they've just moved along latitude lines then they've never come together and those look pretty darn straight

225
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,509
But they're not a straight line never turns and although latitude lines look straight at first glance

226
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,269
following one requires

227
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:54,148
Turning to find straight line paths on surfaces whether they're flat like this or curved

228
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:58,318
I love the ribbon test. Now you can use an actual ribbon

229
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:04,168
But I have found that a strip of paper works. Even better. Let's take a look at this path right here

230
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,318
It's straight at first, but then it curves now if two people are traveling along this curve

231
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:16,079
And they want to stay together the person on the inside will have to cover a shorter distance than the person on the outside

232
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,429
Since both sides of this strip of paper cannot change their lengths

233
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,409
They'll help us find a straight path if the strip of paper can lay flat

234
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,888
We'll know that we have found a straight line and as you can see

235
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,788
The strip can lay flat and follow the straight part of this path

236
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,150
But when it comes to the curve in order to follow the path now

237
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:40,168
The strip well it has too much material on the inside and that material

238
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:46,408
Bunches up and leaves the plane therefore we know that this part of the path is not straight

239
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,199
Let's use the ribbon test to find straight lines on the surface of a cone

240
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,889
Well from the looks of it aligned directly from the base to the tip seems like it would be straight and sure enough

241
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,199
Yeah, the ribbon lays flat on that path, but what about a ring around the cone?

242
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:11,460
Nope doesn't work shorter distances around nearer the tip of the cone mean that there's too much ribbon up at the top

243
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,180
So doesn't lay flat

244
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,469
Let's see what else is there though besides this well if I start here and just allow the ribbon

245
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,690
to lay flat

246
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,370
Huh I get a little curvy looking shape like this

247
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,759
I say curvy looking because while to someone say at the base this path might seem to go up

248
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,779
Slow down change direction and then fall down faster and faster since a ribbon on such a path is flat

249
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,529
It's actually for inhabitants on the cones surface

250
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:48,058
Perfectly straight if we trace the ribbons path on to the cone

251
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:55,138
We can see this clearly because a cone can be flattened a straight line on a curved surface is called a geodesic

252
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,928
Here is a geodesic on a sphere the Equator is one

253
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:05,368
Here's another a line of latitude is not a geodesic

254
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,478
It's not a straight line to see why let's try to follow it with the ribbon you

255
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,139
Know what I have to keep kind of lifting it

256
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:17,428
Yeah, see distances around the sphere becomes shorter as we go up

257
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,799
So there's too much material on the ribbon up here

258
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,628
and it leaves the surface this path contains turns and in order to turn a

259
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,749
Force has to act on you if no forces

260
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:34,618
Did this is the path you would take notice that the ribbon begins moving due east, but then falls

261
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,349
south

262
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,390
Falls

263
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,549
Einstein realized that curvature could cause things to be seemingly attracted to one another

264
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,720
Without needing to invent the existence of forces like gravity

265
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:56,188
but attraction only happens if things move along the surface if they stay still they

266
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:02,369
Well, they don't come together so for something at rest. How does falling begin?

267
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:07,919
I mean the thing has to move in this direction, but it's at rest right well

268
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,490
Yes

269
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,189
But it's only at rest in space and that's not the whole story up down

270
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:22,469
Forward backward and left-right are all you need to describe where an event occur but a complete description will also need to describe

271
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:28,558
When together these four dimensions form the setting in which everything in our universe happens

272
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,660
Space-time

273
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:38,790
Since we can talk about a falling pencil using just one spatial dimension up and down we can use a piece of paper to model

274
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:43,108
Space-time for it. Okay, so we've got up and down, but we have to add another

275
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,460
direction the pencil moves in

276
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,299
time

277
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,338
Now if no forces act on the pencil it won't move through space

278
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,839
It will only get older and as you can see if all it does is get older

279
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,029
It won't fall if space-time was flat when I let go of the pencil

280
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,650
it wouldn't go anywhere, but now let's allow the earth which is massive to manipulate space-time into say a

281
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,190
cone

282
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,980
Now with no forces acting on it every part of the pencil follows a straight line

283
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:20,609
But on a cone as we saw earlier such a path will look like this it will fall

284
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,899
This is because distances around the cone are shorter higher up

285
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,429
Time runs faster further from a massive object, but to go straight

286
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,078
Not turn every part of the pencil must cover an equal distance in space-time

287
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,190
like this

288
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:43,289
Only when the pencil hits the earth does the repulsion of their mutual electrons provide a force pushing the pencil off a geodesic

289
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,949
For the earth time is a series of slices from this evolution the pencils force-free

290
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:57,868
Geodesic is why it falls not a push or pull just the pencils natural tendency to follow a straight line

291
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:04,348
Until something acts on it now. We only used one dimension of space and one of time because

292
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:11,638
Visualizing our universes three of space and one of time would take us beyond the limits of what could be shown on paper or screens

293
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,388
but math

294
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:15,158
Can take us there

295
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,809
General relativity allows us to calculate how much mass and energy

296
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:26,398
Curved space-time and has been used to explain things that Newton's older theory of falling as the result of

297
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:34,377
Forces couldn't like anomalies in the orbit of mercury which orbits nearest the Sun and is therefore most affected by the sun's grip on

298
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:41,308
space-time many other experiments have confirmed general relativity's picture of the universe fitting the conclusion that

299
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:44,009
There is no

300
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,619
Gravity there's just

301
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,399
Space-time its curvature and a us in it. As John Wheeler famously put it

302
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,759
Space-time grips mass telling it how to move mass grips space-time telling it how to curve?

303
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:07,439
Relative to the earth we don't move very fast even jet airplanes move negligibly close to the speed of light

304
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,588
So relative to earth we move almost

305
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,548
Exclusively through time as such we are more affected by the way time is curved by mass

306
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,659
Than how space is curved?

307
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:24,869
This has led many to claim that for the most part you feel as though you're being pushed into the ground

308
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,419
Not because of a force called gravity

309
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,449
But because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet down is

310
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:41,249
Relative and always changing, but it exists because of and is always in the direction of slower time

311
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,838
Bertrand Russell called this the law of cosmic laziness

312
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,759
Everything is naturally steered towards where time is slowest we call this falling

313
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:56,429
going down

314
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,848
So you don't have to keep anything on the down-low

315
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,688
time will take care of that for you and

316
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,490
and as always

317
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,490
